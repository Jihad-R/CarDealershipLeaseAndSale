      @Override
    public double getMonthlyPayment() {
        double monthlyPercentageDepreciation = (4.0 / 12) / 100;

        // Calculate the monthly payment using the total price
        double principle = getTotalPrice();
        return principle * monthlyPercentageDepreciation / (1 - Math.pow(1 + monthlyPercentageDepreciation, -36));
    }
    
This code snippet is interesting because it calculates the monthly payment for a financial transaction based on a total price and a fixed monthly percentage depreciation rate. It demonstrates the application of financial calculations in programming, utilizes mathematical functions, and promotes modular code design.

The code is organized into several classes:

- `Main`: Contains the main method to start the application.
- `Dealership`: Represents a dealership and provides methods to manage the vehicle inventory.
- `Vehicle`: Represents a vehicle with its properties and getters.
- `DealershipFileManager`: Handles file operations to load and save dealership data.
- `DealershipUI`: Handles user input and displays the dealership management command-line interface.
- `MainMenuUI`: Handles user input and displays the main menu command-line interface.
- `ContractUI`: Handles user input and displays the contract management command-line interface.
- `ContractFileManager`: Handles file operations to load and save contract data.

## Class Relationship Diagram
The class relationship diagram illustrates the relationships of the Contract class with other classes in the application. It provides an overview of how the Contract class interacts with and depends on other classes for functionality.
![Class Diagram](screenshots/contractLeaseSaleUML.png)
- The `Contract` class represents a general contract and serves as the base class for LeaseContract and SaleContract.
- The `LeaseContract` class extends the Contract class and adds specific properties such as expectedEnding and leaseFee for lease contracts.
- The `SaleContract` class extends the Contract class and includes additional properties like recordingFee, isFinance, and salesTax for sale contracts.
